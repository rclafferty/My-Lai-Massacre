   	<p>William Calley was born on June 8, 1943 and grew up in Miami, Florida. He attended Palm Beach Junior College for a short time before dropping out due to poor grades. Calley decided to work in the civilian sector in a variety of different jobs before joining the Army at 23 years old. He graduated from Officer Candidate School (OCS) in 1967, commissioned as a Second Lieutenant upon graduation, and immediately assigned as leader of the First Platoon of Charlie Company.</p>
   	<p>In Vietnam, Calley led the first group of soldiers into My Lai. He was the one to ordered that the soldiers kill everyone. As one soldier recalled, the order   	</p>

		<p>Charlie Company was deployed to Vietnam in 1968. Before the My Lai incident, Medina had a great deal of respect from Charlie Company as a feared leader. During the My Lai Massacre, Medina commanded his company to destroy the village, killing everyone in it. They had been informed the 148th Vietcong infantry battalion was being housed there. However, Medina and Calley did not repeal that command even after it was apparent that they were killing innocent civilians, not Vietcong soldiers. He was later court-martialed for his actions but the charges were acquitted. Due to these charges, he was ultimately denied his promotion to major.</p>
		<p>He decided to leave the military without ever speaking publicly about the event and move to Michigan to work in a helicopter manufacturing company.
